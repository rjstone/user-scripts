# User Scripts!

These are my Tampermonkey/GreaseMonkey User Scripts.

They are rather specific to particular web sites, but you could find them useful.

I recommend using them with Tampermonkey, an extension for eevery major browser. But they will work with Greasemonkey and
anything that supports user scripts.

Here is [a small guide](https://codepen.io/rjstone/post/write-a-user-script-with-tampermonkey)
about how to get started with user scripts.

Have fun and don't accidentally install any malicious scripts!
